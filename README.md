# BACE1 Inhibitors and Alzheimer's Disease Research

## Introduction

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks and supporting files for applying computational modeling to BACE1 inhibitors, with a focus on applications in Alzheimer's disease research. The work is inspired by and builds upon the TechOpenCADD project of the Volkamer Lab.

## Project Overview

Over the course of 14 chapters, we have explored various aspects of machine learning, data science and how we can apply them to neurological disease research, particularly focusing on BACE1 inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease. Key topics covered include:

1. Data retrieval and preparation from ChEMBL
2. Compound filtering based on Lipinski's rule of five
3. Calculation and analysis of molecular descriptors and fingerprints
4. Virtual screening and similarity searches
5. Cluster analysis of compounds
6. Identification of maximum common substructures
7. Binding site detection and comparison
8. Neural network-based QSAR modeling

We have applied these methodologies to research on neurological diseases, particularly in the context of BACE1 inhibition for Alzheimer's disease treatment.
